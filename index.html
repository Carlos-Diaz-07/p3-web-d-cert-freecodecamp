            <p>This community DOES NOT BELIEVE Degus are from this world. As soon as you see one, you will understand. Very much like a Flerken, looks deceive you. You MUST follow us and share whatever you learn about your Degu. This is vital for the human race survival.</p>

            <p>No one in this community have ever seen one of them flying but, we DO BELIEVE they can fly. They are hidding many things from us. Please JOIN US and help us discover a Degu's true capabilities.</p>

            <p>DO NOT ever let a cat get near a Degu. In the best case scenario the cat is just a cat and your Degu will just eat it (not a big loss). In the worst case the cat will be a Flerken and your Degu will have stomach pains for a week.</p>
